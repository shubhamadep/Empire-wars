Empire Wars is a 2D multi-player online battle arena video game. There are two teams in the game: Red team and the Blue team, and the objective is to acquire as many flags as possible in the field. The flags are located at different positions in the game field. Each team should at least have two players. The players start from the opposite sides of the field, and they can move in all four directions (Left, Right, Up and Down) and can fire bullets at their opponents.
